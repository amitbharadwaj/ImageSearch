At least 15. 

Which required and optional stories have you completed?
All required. Did all optional except these two:

 I need to learn a bit on styling and coloring.

All libraries except Android universal image loader are in source or lib folder. You need to add Android image loader in order to clone and compile this project.

Used many open source libraries:

 -- TouchView
 -- StaggeredGridView by etsy
 -- SmartImageView
 -- Async Http client
